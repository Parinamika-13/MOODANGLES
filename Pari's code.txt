QII. Maven Web Application Development (30M)

You are hired as a Software Engineer at a tech startup. Your first task involves understanding and setting up a Maven-based Web application for the above project. The template is provided as per the following link.

You are given the following GitHub repository link:
https://github.com/savram674/Smart-Assessment-Hub.git
1.	Download the given GitHub repository. There are few errors in POM.XML correct them and build the project. 10M
2.	The project requires Servlet API dependency. Add the proper Maven dependency for javax.servlet-api:4.0.1. – 5M
3.	What happens if the <version> tag is omitted in a dependency? – 2M
4.	Add a dependency for MySQL Connector/J 8.0.33 to enable database connectivity. – 5M
5.	Package the project as a WAR file and explain how to deploy it on Tomcat. – 3M
6.	Where do you find the added dependency of Servlet in the maven local repository – 2M
7.	Draw the folder structure of your project. Where you find packaged file?  – 3M


1. Download the GitHub repository & fix POM.XML errors (10M)
Steps:
•	Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/savram674/Smart-Assessment-Hub.git
cd Smart-Assessment-Hub
•	Open pom.xml. Common errors usually include:
o	Wrong plugin/dependency names (like <dependecy> instead of <dependency>).
o	Missing <groupId>, <artifactId>, or <version> tags.
o	Incorrect <packaging> (should be war for web apps).
✅ Example corrected structure:
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 
                             http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>com.kmit</groupId>
    <artifactId>smart-assessment-hub</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <packaging>war</packaging>
    
    <dependencies>
        <!-- Servlet & MySQL will be added in next steps -->
    </dependencies>
</project>
Build the project:
mvn clean install
________________________________________
2. Add Servlet API Dependency (javax.servlet-api:4.0.1) (5M)
Inside <dependencies>:
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.servlet-api</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.1</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
👉 scope=provided means Tomcat/Server provides it at runtime.
________________________________________
3. What happens if <version> tag is omitted? (2M)
•	Maven tries to use the latest version available in repositories.
•	This can lead to build failures if the latest version has breaking changes.
•	Best practice → always specify <version>.
________________________________________
4. Add MySQL Connector/J 8.0.33 Dependency (5M)
<dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-j</artifactId>
    <version>8.0.33</version>
</dependency>
This allows database connectivity with MySQL.
________________________________________
5. Package project as WAR & deploy on Tomcat (3M)
•	In pom.xml, ensure:
<packaging>war</packaging>
•	Build WAR file:
mvn clean package
•	Output file:
target/smart-assessment-hub-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war
Deployment:
1.	Copy WAR → $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/
2.	Start Tomcat → bin/startup.sh (Linux) or startup.bat (Windows).
3.	Access → http://localhost:8080/smart-assessment-hub
________________________________________
6. Where is the Servlet dependency stored? (2M)
•	Local Maven Repository → ~/.m2/repository (Linux/Mac) OR C:\Users\<username>\.m2\repository (Windows).
•	Exact path:
~/.m2/repository/javax/servlet/javax.servlet-api/4.0.1/
________________________________________
7. Folder Structure & Packaged File Location (3M)
📂 Maven Web App Structure
Smart-Assessment-Hub/
│── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/                # Java source files

Nice ⚡ Let’s break down QIV – Docker containerization for Maven Web App (20M) step by step.
________________________________________
1. Check Docker version & list images (2M)
docker --version
docker images
👉 Confirms installation & shows downloaded images.
________________________________________
2. Pull and run hello-world image (2M)
docker pull hello-world
docker run hello-world
👉 Simple test that Docker is working.
________________________________________
3. Run python image in interactive mode (2M)
docker pull python
docker run -it python
👉 Drops you into a Python REPL inside the container.
________________________________________
4. Dockerfile for Smart Assessment Hub (3M)
Your Maven project (WAR) should be deployed on Tomcat.
Dockerfile:
# Use official Tomcat base image
FROM tomcat:9.0

# Maintainer info (optional)
LABEL maintainer="yourname@example.com"

# Copy WAR file to Tomcat webapps directory
COPY target/smart-assessment-hub-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/smart-assessment-hub.war

# Expose Tomcat default port
EXPOSE 8080

# Start Tomcat
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
________________________________________
5. Build image & run container (2M)
docker build -t smarthub-image .
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name smarthub-container smarthub-image
👉 -d = detached, -p = port mapping.
👉 Access app → http://localhost:8080/smart-assessment-hub.
________________________________________
6. List all containers (2M)
docker ps -a
👉 Shows running & stopped containers.
________________________________________
7. Start & stop container (2M)
docker stop smarthub-container
docker start smarthub-container
________________________________________
8. Push custom image to Docker Hub (3M)
1.	Login to Docker Hub:
docker login
2.	Tag image:
docker tag smarthub-image yourdockerhubusername/smarthub-image:v1
3.	Push image:
docker push yourdockerhubusername/smarthub-image:v1
________________________________________
9. Inspect logs of a container (2M)
docker logs smarthub-container
👉 Useful for debugging Tomcat startup or app errors.
________________________________________
✅ That’s a full solution for QIV (20M).
Do you also want me to prepare a ready-to-run docker-compose.yml (Tomcat + MySQL) for QV? That way you’ll have both QIV and QV covered smoothly.
You said:
QV. DOCKER COMPOSE -10M Your have successfully built Smart Assessment Hub using Maven and pushed the application image to Docker Hub. The next step is to run the application along with a Tomcat and run the containers. Also include a database for future use (MYSQL) 1. create a multi folder docker-compose.yml for your Smart Assessment Hub Project with Tomcat Server and include a database mysql to be used at port 3306. Add volumes for persistency. Show both the containers running using docker compose up command -- 5M 2. Container 1 – Access Tomcat at port 8080 -- 2M 3. Container 2 – Execute your database to add a new table -- 3M 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ✅ Let’s wrap up with QV – Docker Compose (10M). This will combine your Smart Assessment Hub app (Tomcat WAR) and a MySQL database into a multi-container setup.
________________________________________
1. Create a multi-folder docker-compose.yml (5M)
📂 Project structure:
Smart-Assessment-Hub/
│── docker-compose.yml
│── app/           # For Tomcat + SmartHub image
│── db/            # For MySQL persistence
📌 docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  sah-app:
    image: yourdockerhubusername/smarthub-image:v1   # custom image from QIV
    container_name: sah-app
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - sah-db
    networks:
      - sah-network

  sah-db:
    image: mysql:8.0
    container_name: sah-db
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root123
      MYSQL_DATABASE: sahdb
      MYSQL_USER: sahuser
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: sahpass
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - sah-network

volumes:
  db_data:

networks:
  sah-network:
👉 This defines two containers:
•	sah-app → Tomcat running Smart Assessment Hub (port 8080).
•	sah-db → MySQL database with persistence (volume).
Run them:
docker-compose up -d
Check containers:
docker ps
________________________________________
2. Container 1 – Access Tomcat at port 8080 (2M)
Open browser:
http://localhost:8080/smart-assessment-hub
________________________________________
3. Container 2 – Execute database & add table (3M)
Connect to MySQL container:
docker exec -it sah-db mysql -u root -p
(password = root123)
Inside MySQL:
USE sahdb;
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    marks INT
);
✅ Now you have Tomcat + MySQL running together with persistence.
